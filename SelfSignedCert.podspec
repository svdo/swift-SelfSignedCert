  s.description   = <<-DESC
                    On iOS, you cannot simply create self-signed certificates.
                    You could try and pull out OpenSSL, but that will turn into
                    a nightmare very quickly. This library provides functionality
                    to create self-signed certificates in Swift. DISCLAIMER: I
                    am no security expert. This library has not been audited by
                    one. I just ported a part of another library, copying many
                    of the unit tests in there, but I don't know if they were all
                    correct... Use at your own risk! By the way: if you are a
                    security expert and want to audit this library, that would
                    earn you LOTS and LOTS of gratitude! Please contact me.
